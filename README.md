## lets start to code step by step

1. make the login and register UI
3. publish:lang then add fa and en and ... languages
2. for support localization we use `@lang('')` or `__('')` for static content of the website.
3. showing the errors -> make a blade file in partials folder `validation-errors.blade.php` 
4. showing the alerts -> make a blade file in partials folder `alert.blade.php`
5. use @guest and @auth for `login\register` navbar button
